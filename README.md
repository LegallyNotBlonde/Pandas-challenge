In this project, we analyzed schools in a specific district to understand student performance and how it relates to school size, budget, type, and etc. Our goal was to provide insights into factors influencing student outcomes.

Overview of the Analysis:
Key Metrics: We examined total and average values such as school sizes, budgets, and student performance across all schools in the district and for each individual school.
Correlations: We explored how student performance correlates with different school characteristics, including school size, type (Charter vs. District), budget, or even students Grades (age groups).

Performance Rankings: We identified the top 5 highest performing schools and the 5 lowest performing schools, based on the average percentage of students who passed both math and reading tests.

* Key Findings:
1. School Type and Performance:
Charter Schools consistently outperform District Schools in all metrics, including math and reading scores and passing rates.

2. School Size and Performance:
Smaller (<1,000 students) and medium-sized (1,000-2,000 students) schools have better student performance than larger schools (2,000-5,000 students).

3. Budget vs. Performance:
School budget, whether total or per student, has less impact on performance compared to school type and size. The top 5 highest-performing schools are all Charter schools with efficient budget use, while all 5 of the lowest-performing are District schools with higher budgets per student.

* Recommendations:
Investing in small and medium-sized Charter schools could be beneficial as they show higher student achievement and efficient budget use.
